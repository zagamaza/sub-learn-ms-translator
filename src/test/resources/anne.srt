We made a practical decision; we'll
just have to hope for the best.

21
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:36,781
With any luck, Mrs. Spencer
will have picked out a good one;

22
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:40,084
a hard worker and
obedient like we asked for.

23
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,888
I couldn't tolerate a
lazy boy or a sullen boy.

24
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:46,424
No, I couldn't abide it and I wouldn't.

25

In spite of all the
worry, I'm relieved to know

Matthew Cuthbert, you
must be in a state.

Since when do you sit at the
table without washing your hands?

Let's not forget you were the
one convinced of this plan.

You've been set on it since winter,

33
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,098
so there's no point fretting now.

34
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,061
Not that I disagree, because I don't.

35
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:40,210
Will you be ready to set off
as soon as you're finished here?

I will.

You can bet it won't take long
for Rachel to come a-knocking.

She needs her diaper changed, Mrs.
Hammond. The stew is almost ready.

- No. Not yet, but I...

for you about Green Gables.

I'm sure you do.

65

Why do you suppose neither
of the Cuthberts ever married?

66
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,945
Did either of them
have a tragical romance?

- It's none of our business.
- But I'm bursting with curiosity!

Sir.

77
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:56,353
I wonder if you can
help me. Is there a...

78
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:59,623
Little girl? You didn't
see her? She's just outside.

79
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:01,859
Wouldn't come in. Darndest thing.

80
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:04,694
- But...
- Said she preferred to sit outside,

81
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,631
because there was... What was it now?

82
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,451
"More scope for the imagination."

83
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:12,435
That was it. She's a case, I should say.

I heard her talkin'
to herself out there.

00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:20,525
It's a boy... that I have come for.

00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,480
Mrs. Spencer was to bring him
over from the asylum for us.

88
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:26,427
Mrs. Spencer got off the train
with that strange snippet,

89
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:27,985
gave her over to my charge.

90
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,586
Said you'd be along for her presently.

00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,955
Well, that's all I know about it.

92

orphans concealed hereabouts.

Well, I'm sure the girl
will be only too happy

00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:43,336
to tell you every little
detail of what happened.

96
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:46,336
She's got a tongue of her
own, that's for certain.

[chuckling] Good day to you.

98
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:01,109
I suppose you are Matthew
Cuthbert of Green Gables?

99
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:03,486
I'm very glad to see you.
I was beginning to be afraid

100
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,121
that you weren't coming
and I was imagining

101
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:07,607
all the things that might
have happened to prevent you.

102
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:10,059
I'd made up my mind that
if you didn't come for me,

103
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:12,629
I'd go down the tracks to
that big wild cherry tree

104
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,797
and climb up into it and stay all night.

105
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,233
I wouldn't be a bit afraid,
and it would be lovely to sleep

106
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:21,047
in a tree all white with bloom
in the moonshine, don't you think?

107
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:28,844
I can also imagine that I'm
already a disappointment to you.

108
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,830
I'm aware that I'm not much to look at,

109
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,988
but even though I'm
thin, I'm very strong.

110
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,378
I want you to know that I'm forever
grateful that you're adopting me.

111
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:43,885
You're a sight for
sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert.

112
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:47,562
You best come along.

113
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:49,130
Uh - ahem - I'll take your bag.

114
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,814
Oh, I can carry it. It isn't heavy.

115
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,435
I've got all my worldly goods
in it, but it isn't heavy.

116
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:56,504
And if it isn't carried a certain way,

117
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,806
it falls right open,
so I better keep it.

118
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:01,142
I've come to know the exact knack of it.

119
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:04,831
I am ecstatic beyond measure

120
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,781
that I'm going to belong
to you and your sister.

121
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:10,633
Ecstatic! I've never
belonged to anybody before.

122
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,081
I mean, you and your sister are
practically the stuff of fiction.

123
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,776
Two hard-working, decent people,

124
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,602
lonely all their lives
in their silent house,

125
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,593
longing for the love of a child.

126
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,034
And I will strive to be
just the best daughter

127
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,042
that anybody could ever have.

128
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,135
I'm sure that I can do it.

129
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,409
To be honest, I haven't
had much experience at it.

130
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:34,412
I'm not usually brought into
a house to be a daughter,

131
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,502
so you can well imagine what a blessing

132
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,045
this is and how much my heart is lifted.

133
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,416
And I've given it a lot of thought,

134
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,285
and I am determined
that I shall be obedient,

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,788
and dutiful and yet lively enough

136
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,917
so as to lighten up the place

137
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:51,893
after you've lived for so many years

138
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,060
without the delights of a happy child

139
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,103
and the scope of her imagination.

140
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,300
Have you always wanted a daughter?

141
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,236
Always in your heart of hearts?

142
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,558
I read once that "a
daughter is a little girl"

143
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,650
who grows up to be a friend."

144
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:12,879
And it gives my heart a
thrill to even say it aloud.

145
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,483
Oh, isn't she lovely?

146
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,479
- What's her name?
- Uh...

147
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:22,394
that's, uh... the mare.

148
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,388
She doesn't have a name?

149
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:27,293
But the right name is so important.

150
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,197
She looks to me...
like her name is Belle.

151
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:33,915
Hello, Belle. You are a beauty,

152
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,069
and I am sure we'll be great friends.

153
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,205
- Mare.
- [clucking]

154
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:51,316
Bye, tree!

155
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,626
That cherry tree is my first
friend here on the Island.

156
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,863
What did that cherry tree, all
white and lacy, make you think of?

157
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,323
Well, now, um, I dunno.

158
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,400
Why, a bride, of course!

159
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,171
A bride all in white with a misty veil.

160
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:16,174
I've never seen one, but I
imagine what she would look like.

161
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,477
I never expect to be a bride myself.

162
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,513
I'm so homely, nobody
would ever want to marry me.

163
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,562
Unless he was a foreign missionary.

164
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:26,354
I suppose a foreign missionary
mightn't be very particular.

165
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:28,986
But I do hope someday I
shall have a white dress,

166
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,687
with beautiful puff sleeves.

167
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,891
That is my highest
ideal of earthly bliss.

168
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,661
Am I talking too much?

169
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,434
People are always telling me that I do,

170
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,525
and it seems to cause
no end of aggravation.

171
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,759
Would you rather I didn't
talk? If you say so, I'll stop.

172
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,753
I can stop when I make up my mind
to it, although it's difficult.

173
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:52,676
I don't mind.

174
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,345
I'm so glad.

175
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,648
I know you and I are going to
get along together just fine.

176
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,217
It's such a relief to
talk when one wants to

177
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,286
and not be told that children
should be seen and not heard.

178
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,657
I've had that said to me a
million times if I have once.

179
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,746
People would laugh at me
because I use big words.

180
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,198
But they're exciting
and descriptive words,

181
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:16,640
like... like "enraptured"
and "glorious"!

182
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,507
If you have big ideas, you have to use

183
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:20,567
big words to express them, haven't you?

184
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,597
Well, uh...

185
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,969
I suppose so.

186
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,509
For example:

187
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:32,750
I am enraptured by
this glorious landscape!

188
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,021
Careful now. Careful.

189
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,532
[knocking]

190
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,382
Afternoon, Rachel.

191
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,079
I've put the kettle on.

192
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,321
Won't you sit down?

193
00:12:57,321 --> 00:13:00,094
I don't want to interrupt
if you're expecting company.

194
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:03,969
Oh, we've got plenty of time. Matthew
won't be back for several hours.

195
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,679
I took quite a fright when I
saw Matthew starting off today.

196
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,456
- I can imagine.
- Well...

197
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:12,010
I couldn't imagine what might cause him

198
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:14,780
to leave his crop in the
middle of the afternoon.

199
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:17,909
I was fearful he'd gone
to call for the doctor.

200
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:20,385
- Oh, I'm quite well.
- Oh!

201
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,355
What a relief. Oh, my, my, my.

202
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,983
[sighing] Of course, now
that I have time to think,

203
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:30,362
it wouldn't make sense for
Matthew to take the time

204
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:34,032
to put on his best set of clothes
had there been an emergency.

205
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,702
No... it wouldn't.

206
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,571
No... indeed.

207
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,709
Oh, for heaven's sake, Marilla.

208
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,873
Matthew's gone to the train
station at Bright River.

209
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:51,335
Ah. Well, well.

210
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,367
Bright River.

211
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,486
He's fetching a hired hand.

212
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,259
Yes and no.

213
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,364
We're adopting a boy
from the orphan asylum

214
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,895
in Nova Scotia, and he's arriving today.

215
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,230
Matthew's gone to fetch him.

216
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,565
Marilla Cuthbert,

217
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,280
if you had told me that
Matthew was meeting a...

218
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,546
kangaroo from Australia, I
couldn't be more surprised.

219
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:15,406
An orphan boy?!

220
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,801
What on earth put such
a notion into your head?

221
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,879
Because I'm gonna tell you plain:

222
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,649
you're doing a mighty foolish thing...

223
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,573
a risky thing, that's what.

224
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:27,784
[soft music]

225
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:32,056
[squawking]

226
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:48,376
I cannot believe that I'm going to
get to live somewhere so beautiful.

227
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,707
Dreams don't often come true, do they?

228
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:54,044
But just now I feel...
pretty nearly perfectly happy.

229
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,979
Although I can't feel
exactly perfectly happy,

230
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,019
because, well... what
colour would you call this?

231
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,819
It's red... isn't it?

232
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,162
Yes, it's red.

233
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,125
Now you see why I can't
be perfectly happy.

234
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Nobody could who has red hair.

235
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:13,529
It's... my lifelong sorrow.

236
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,242
You don't know what you're getting.

237
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,664
You're letting a strange
child into your house

238
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:21,737
and you don't know a
single thing about him!

239
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,903
Why, only last week I
was reading in the paper

240
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:29,011
how a man and his wife
up west of the Island

241
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,680
took an orphan boy out of the asylum

242
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,683
and he set fire to their home at night!

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,874
Set it on purpose, Marilla!

244
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,622
And they nearly burned
to a crisp in their beds!

245
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:44,060
Now, if you would've asked
for my advice on this matter,

246
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,995
- which you didn't do...
- Sugar?

247
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,304
...I would've told
you, for mercy's sake,

248
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,754
not to think of such
a thing, that's what!

249
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,938
I don't deny there's something
in what you say, Rachel.

250
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:58,370
I've... I've had some qualms myself.

251
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:00,291
How could you not?

252
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:04,312
Matthew is getting on in years
and his heart's been bothering him.

253
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,426
A boy will be a great help.

254
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:09,116
And it isn't as if he's
coming from overseas

255
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,921
or the States. He's from Nova Scotia.

256
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,788
He can't be much
different than ourselves.

257
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,668
Well, there is some comfort in that,

258
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,227
knowing he's not some London street Arab

259
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,522
or some French ruffian.

260
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,524
An orphan, Marilla?

261
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:27,433
Matthew's been terrible set on it.

262
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,892
Well, I hope and pray
it works all right.

263
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:33,475
Only, don't say I didn't warn you

264
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:37,492
if he burns Green Gables down
or puts strychnine in the well.

265
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,648
I heard of a case over in New Brunswick

266
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,083
where an orphan-asylum
child did just that,

267
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,723
and the whole family
died in fearful agonies.

268
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,662
Only, it was a girl in that instance.

269
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:49,390
Well, we're not getting a girl.

270
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,571
Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!

271
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,499
What do they call this place?

272
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:55,733
The Avenue.

273
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,438
I suppose it is kind of pretty.

274
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,371
Pretty doesn't seem
the right word to use,

275
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:04,358
nor beautiful, either.
They don't go far enough.

276
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,278
It's...

277
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,390
wonderful.

278
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,126
Wonderful.

279
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:13,390
It's the first thing I
ever saw that couldn't

280
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,209
be improved upon by the imagination.

281
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,984
Other people may call it The Avenue,

282
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,909
but I shall always call it

283
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,160
the White Way of Delight.

284
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,663
[soft music]

285
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,929
This here's Barry's Pond.

286
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,801
Oh, I don't like that name, either.

287
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,403
I shall call it...

288
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,206
let me see...

289
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:39,009
the Lake of Shining Waters.

290
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,129
Yes, that's the right name for it.

291
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:44,264
I know because of the thrill.

292
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,503
Do things ever give you a thrill?

293
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:49,193
Well, I don't rightly know.

294
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,520
There has to be something.

295
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,823
Well, now, um...

296
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,631
I suppose it... kind
of gives me a thrill

297
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:01,309
to see those ugly white grubs

298
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,266
that spade up in the cucumber beds.

299
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,327
I suppose I can imagine that.

300
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,339
I hate the look of them.
I'd like to be rid of them.

301
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:11,307
I suppose I gave Mrs.
Hammond a thrill, then.

302
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,410
She was happy to be rid of
me after her husband died.

303
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,045
Who's Mrs. Hammond?

304
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,005
I worked for her family, taking
care of the children for a few years.

305
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,563
She had eight.

306
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,498
It sure seems to make some people angry

307
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,344
when they have so many children.

308
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,392
Mr. and Mrs. Hammond were
certainly vexed all the time.

309
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,139
<i>[Mr. Hammond]: Move,
you little scarecrow!</i>

310
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:32,294
<i>[Anne]: Please, please, I...</i>

311
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,829
- This'll teach ya.
- [crying]

312
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,817
[screaming]

313
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:40,011
- Ah!
- Mr. Hammond?!

314
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,153
- [barking]
- [groaning]

315
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:46,407
- Mrs. Hammond!!! Mrs. Hammond!!!
- [groaning]

316
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:48,609
- [panting]
- [barking]

317
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:52,379
[squawking]

318
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,992
Is anything the matter?

319
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:00,592
No. Nothing.

320
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,163
I was startled by the geese, is all.

321
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:07,137
Don't you just love
them? The geese? I do.

322
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,345
They're a very romantical
species of bird.

323
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,898
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

324
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,868
Did you know they mate for life?

325
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,472
They choose each other out
of all the geese in the world,

326
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,375
and they stay together
until death do they part.

327
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:24,415
Well, now.

328
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:27,252
We're pretty near home.

329
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,473
Just another mile or so.

330
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,087
Home.

331
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:34,754
What a wonderful word.

332
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:41,941
Green Gables.

333
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:44,842
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

334
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,667
I've pinched myself so many times today.

335
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,529
Every little while, this horrible,

336
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:52,489
sickening feeling would come over me,

337
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:54,841
and I'd be so afraid
that this was all a dream.

338
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,752
But I just had to one more time.

339
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,572
This is real.

340
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,618
Green Gables is real and we're home.

341
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,355
- Mare.
- [clucking]

342
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:32,711
[soft music]

343
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:54,124
Matthew Cuthbert, who's that?

344
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,028
Where is the boy?

345
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,772
There wasn't any boy.

346
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,491
There was only her.

347
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:06,434
No boy? But there must've been a boy.

348
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:08,956
We sent word to Mrs.
Spencer to bring us a boy.

349
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,417
Well, she didn't.

350
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:12,972
She brought her.

351
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:15,464
I asked the stationmaster.

352
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,447
I had to bring her home.

353
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:19,112
She couldn't be left there,

354
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:21,105
no matter where the mistake had come in.

355
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:24,382
Well, this is a pretty
piece of business.

356
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,844
She's got to go back.

357
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,173
You don't want me.

358
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,084
I should've expected it.

359
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,788
I might've known nobody
would really want me.

360
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,206
Oh, for heaven's sake, child,
what are you doing on the ground?

361
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,584
Now, you listen here and stand up.

362
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:48,301
- What do you make of this?
- I, uh...

363
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,036
I figure...

364
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:53,315
she's traveled a long
way to be disappointed.

365
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,040
Well, she shouldn't be here.

366
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,282
You should never have brought her home.

367
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:58,577
<i>[distantly]: She's had a shock.</i>

368
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,913
<i>[distantly]: She's not the only one.</i>

369
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,177
Enough of this foolishness.

370
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:07,185
<i>[distantly]: Come along inside.</i>

371
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,387
<i>I'm speaking to you, child.</i>

372
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:13,224
<i>Little girl, that's enough now.</i>

373
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:15,961
<i>Little girl.</i>

374
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:18,356
Little girl!

375
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,199
Little girl?

376
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,602
I wish I was anything but.

377
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,030
There's no point in crying.

378
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:26,939
There's been a mistake, is all.

379
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:29,782
We're not going to turn
you out-of-doors tonight.

380
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,236
What is your name?

381
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:33,898
What does it matter?

382
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,647
I won't be here long
enough for you to remember.

383
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:39,084
You will mind your manners
and answer the question.

384
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:44,505
Please... call me Cordelia.

385
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:47,630
Call you Cordelia? Is that your name?

386
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,247
Or Penelope.

387
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,896
Penelope has a very tragical ring to it.

388
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,764
What is your name, child?

389
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,168
Couldn't you call me either of those?

390
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:03,891
My name is Anne.

391
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,344
Plain Anne.

392
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,704
Anne is a fine name.

393
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:11,461
A sensible name.

394
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,714
Could you please spell it
with an E when you speak it?

395
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:18,379
Anne with an E looks
much more distinguished.

396
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,719
Very well, then,

397
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:23,088
Anne with an E,

398
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,779
it's time to come inside.

399
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,276
Get yourself up now.

400
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:31,296
[birdsong]

401
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,092
I knew it.

402
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,789
This is a lovely home.

403
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:50,940
Why didn't you tell me at the train
station that you didn't want me?

404
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,406
Why didn't you just leave me there?

405
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,976
If I hadn't seen the
White Way of Delight

406
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:59,178
or the Lake of Shining Waters,
this wouldn't be so hard.

407
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:01,057
What on earth does she mean?

408
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:02,790
It's just a conversation...

409
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:05,065
we had on the road.

410
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:08,349
I'll put the mare in.

411
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:14,273
[Marilla sighing] Take off your hat.

412
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:16,729
Lay it and your bag on the bench.

413
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:22,668
I simply don't understand.

414
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:24,742
Were there no boys at the asylum?

415
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,799
There was an abundance of them.

416
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:30,876
But Mrs. Spencer said distinctly
that you wanted a girl about my age,

417
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:33,144
and the matron thought that I would do.

418
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:36,509
This is what comes of sending
word and not going ourselves.

419
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:39,050
Follow me. Don't dally.

420
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:42,321
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but there's nothing to be done.

421
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,462
We want a boy to help
Matthew with the farm work.

422
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:48,740
A girl would be of no use
to us. Do you understand?

423
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:52,563
- I can't say that I do.
- I beg your pardon?

424
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,130
I don't mean any disrespect, but

425
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:56,349
couldn't I do the farm
chores even though I'm a girl?

426
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,737
That's not the way of
things and you know it.

427
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,172
But couldn't I? I'm as strong as a boy,

428
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:04,427
and I prefer to be outdoors
instead of cooped up in a kitchen.

429
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,844
I don't understand the conundrum.

430
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:09,412
For example, what if, suddenly,

431
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:12,310
there were no boys in
the world, none at all...

432
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:13,383
Fiddlesticks.

433
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:16,754
It doesn't make sense that girls
aren't allowed to do farm work

434
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:19,957
when girls can do anything
a boy can do and more!

435
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:23,470
Do you consider yourself to
be delicate and incapable?

436
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:25,095
Because I certainly don't.

437
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,932
Anyway, since I'm here now,
couldn't you consider it?

438
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:32,351
I could not. And put those
fool notions out of your head.

439
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,531
Now come along. Let's get
you washed up for supper.

440
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:44,947
Oh, good gracious, child,
what's happened here?

441
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:52,421
I was pinching myself a lot today,

442
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:54,590
to prove that this was all true.

443
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:11,007
You're not eating at all.

444
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:12,809
I can't.

445
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:14,249
I'm sorry.

446
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:16,428
I'm in the depths of despair.

447
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:20,015
Can you eat when you're
in the depths of despair?

448
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:24,052
I've never been in the depths
of despair, so I can't say.

449
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:28,779
Well, did you ever imagine that
you were in the depths of despair?

450
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,236
No, I didn't.

451
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:33,570
It's a very uncomfortable
feeling indeed.

452
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,208
When you try to eat, a big lump
comes right up into your throat,

453
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,396
and you can't swallow anything,

454
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,503
not even if it was a chocolate caramel.

455
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:48,318
I had chocolate caramel once, two
years ago, and it was simply delicious.

456
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:51,454
I hope you won't be
offended that I can't eat.

457
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,043
Everything is extremely nice.

458
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,859
I guess she's just tired.

459
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,194
Best put her to bed.

460
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,466
Fetch your bag and follow me.

461
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:22,884
[sighing]

462
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,887
[door creaking]

463
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:31,726
[soft music]

464
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,730
Undress, quick as you can, get to bed.

465
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:44,573
I'll come back in a few
minutes for the candle.

466
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:54,616
[panting and sniffling]

467
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,341
[crying]

468
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:03,524
[sobbing]

469
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:14,675
[sobbing]

470
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,215
Good night.

471
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:26,535
How can you call it a good night

472
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,561
when you know this must be the
very worst night I've ever had?

473
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:34,721
[sobbing]

474
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:50,904
Oh, that is a filthy habit.

475
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,417
I dare say a man's
got a right to smoke...

476
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,201
when his mind's burdened.

477
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:59,579
I dare say yours is, too.

478
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:02,385
Yes, this is certainly
a fine kettle of fish.

479
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,450
One of us will have to drive over

480
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:06,641
and see Mrs. Spencer
tomorrow, that's for certain.

481
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,686
The girl will have to be sent back.

482
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:11,752
Yup, I suppose so.

483
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,985
You suppose so? Don't you know it?

484
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,126
Well, it...

485
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,612
seems a pity

486
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:19,764
to send her back.

487
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,406
She's so set on staying.

488
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:26,284
Matthew Cuthbert, do you mean to
say you think we ought to keep her?!

489
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,308
No, no, I-I-I-I...

490
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,080
No, I suppose not.

491
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,836
I should say not.

492
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,715
What good would she be to us?

493
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:40,451
We might be some good to her.

494
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,934
I believe that child has bewitched you.

495
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:46,229
I can see it plain as
plain you want to keep her.

496
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,349
She's a real interesting kind of person.

497
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,221
That's one way to put it.

498
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:55,884
You should've heard her
talk coming from the station.

499
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:59,677
She can talk fast enough and
it's nothing in her favour.

500
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,142
I don't mind the conversation.

501
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,816
I don't like children
who have so much to say.

502
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,186
There's something I don't
understand about her.

503
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,723
No, she's got to be dispatched
straight way back where she came from.

504
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:17,319
I could hire a boy to help me and, uh...

505
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:19,243
she could be company for you.

506
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:22,465
I'm not suffering for company.
And I'm not gonna keep her.

507
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:28,071
Well, now, it's just as you say...

508
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,685
of course.

509
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:37,848
I'm going to bed.

510
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,625
[Anne crying]

511
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:52,762
[crickets chirring]

512
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:54,431
[trilling]

513
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,299

[birdsong]

517
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,468
[soft music]

518
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,980
Dearest Snow Queen,

519
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,592
I accept your token offering.

520
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:31,580
Had I a book,

521
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:34,713
I would press these sacred
blossoms between its pages

522
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:38,845
so that I could forever be
reminded of this treasured moment.

523
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:41,191
Nevertheless...

524
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:43,964
...I...

525
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,154
Princess Cordelia...

526
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:52,159
...shall cherish this gift always.

527
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:00,399
Let my kiss prove my devotion...

528
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:02,435
- [door opens]
- What are you doing?

529
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,097
It's time you were dressed.

530
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,633
I was imagining that this morning

531
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:13,083
was different than what it is.

532
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:14,579
I was making believe that...

533
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,348
I was a beautiful princess

534
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,960
and this was my sacred chamber,

535
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:21,920
high in a tall stone spire...

536
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,889
Never mind your chatter.

537
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,086
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:31,328
It's just that your gable room
and your lovely old cherry tree

539
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:34,232
provide such scope for the imagination.

540
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,221
I've... also been wishing

541
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,037
with all my might that you'd tell me

542
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:41,773
that you'd decided that I could stay.

543
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,507
Pack that inside and come downstairs.

544
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,879
We'll be driving to see
Mrs. Spencer after breakfast.

545
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,971
[soft music]

546
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,466
Put that down at once!

547
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:11,645
- Did you take anything?
- No!

548
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,987
I was only memorizing.

549
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:16,752
Let me see.

550
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,675
Stop your snooping
and come to breakfast.

551
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:39,265
I'm pretty hungry this morning.

552
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,058
The world doesn't seem such a howling
wilderness as it did last night.

553
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:49,565
I'm glad it's a pretty morning so
we won't be driving back in the rain.

554
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,495
That would be extremely
difficult to bear.

555
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:55,570
It's all very well to...
read sorrowful stories

556
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:58,773
and imagine yourself living
through them heroically, but...

557
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,549
it's not so easy when you're
actually woeful, is it?

558
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:03,536
For pity's sake, hold your tongue.

559
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,737
You talk entirely too much.

560
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,178
Yes, ma'am.

561
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:13,521
Just so's you know, I sent
word to see if that French boy

562
00:35:13,557 --> 00:35:15,387
is available through harvest.

563
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,062
- Gracious me!
- I can milk a cow and split wood!

564
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:24,984
I can wash clothes, iron, dust,
sweep and so many other things!

565
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,062
There's no end to what I could
accomplish given the chance.

566
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:29,103
I'll take care of these
dishes for you, Miss Cuthbert.

567
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:31,094
You will see, I'll do them right.

568
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,055
Be careful with the kettle.
It's very hot. Use both hands.

569
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:42,383
I see it clear now:
this very idea was folly.

570
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:44,318
You can't make up a family.

571
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,182
Only kin is kin.

572
00:35:48,858 --> 00:35:50,658
<i>[thunder rumbling]</i>

573
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,964
Surely you'll be needing...

574
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:01,936
Anne more than ever since
your husband's passing.

575
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:03,242
I don't want her.

576
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,006
I'm moving to mysister's and
I got no reason to take her.

577
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,074
I'm sorry, but we're
overcrowded as it is.

578
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,178
- I don't need another mouth to feed.
- [Anne]: But I can help you.

579
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:14,782
Haven't I been of help to you?
Please don't leave me here.

580
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,618
You're not kin. I got enough kin.

581
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,412
You're taking her back and that's final.

582
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,463
[thunder]

583
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,579
[utensils falling]

584
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:35,919
I'm so sorry! Nothing's broken.

585
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:39,889
Oh, you'll never keep me now.

586
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,638
I was never going to keep you.

587
00:36:51,562 --> 00:36:53,630
I'll be back in time for tea.

588
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,121
Anne...

589
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:57,057
Goodbye, Mr. Cuthbert.

590
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,685
I, uh... didn't say I'd hire a boy

591
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,462
to be rid of you.

592
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:04,898
It was in hopes that you could stay.

593
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:10,258
Thank you.

594
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:12,946
I'll never forget you.

595
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,790
You take care now...

596
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:17,877
...Anne with an E.

597
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:20,813
Oh, for heaven's sake.

598
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:22,448
[clucking]

599
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:28,314
My brother is a ridiculous man.

600
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:31,330
I think he's lovely.
He's ever so sympathetic,

601
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:33,384
and he didn't seem to
mind how much I talked.

602
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:34,993
In fact, he seemed to like it.

603
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:38,163
I felt he was a kindred spirit
as soon as ever I saw him.

604
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:40,654
You're both queer enough,
that's for sure and certain.

605
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:44,115
I've made up my mind
to enjoy this drive.

606
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:46,671
It's been my experience that you
can nearly always enjoy something

607
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:49,171
if you make up your mind
firmly that you will.

608
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,968
Of course, you must
make up your mind firmly.

609
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,213
I believe this is something
you and I have in common.

610
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,752
[seagulls squawking]

611
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,933
I wish I was a seagull. They're
the most carefree of all the birds,

612
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,344
don't you think?

613
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,471
Look.

614
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,242
Wild roses! Isn't pink just
the most bewitching colour?

615
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:26,411
I love it, but I can't wear it.

616
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:29,351
Redheaded people can't wear
pink, not even in the imagination.

617
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:32,182
Do you know of anybody whose
hair was red when she was young,

618
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:34,751
but got to be another
colour when she grew up?

619
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,674
I shouldn't think it likely.

620
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:39,789
There's another hope gone.

621
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,760
"My life is a perfect
graveyard of buried hopes."

622
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:45,742
I read that sentence in a book once,

623
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:49,433
and I say it to comfort myself
whenever I'm disappointed in anything.

624
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,435
Don't see where the
comforting comes in, myself.

625
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,651
Because it sounds so romantic,

626
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,507
as if I were a heroine in a storybook.

627
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,438
- You must've gone to school.
- Not a great deal,

628
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,056
although I went recently
when I was back at the asylum.

629
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,982
I love school, but when I'm in a
household with so much to attend to,

630
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:09,084
the children and the cooking and
the chores, it just wasn't an option.

631
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,058
Is there a reason why
Green Gables is so secluded?

632
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:17,575
A reason?

633
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:20,762
My family wasn't inclined
toward idle chatter.

634
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:24,066
Do you miss your parents terribly?

635
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:26,418
They lived good, Christian lives.

636
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,905
You can't begrudge God
for bringing them home.

637
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:30,740
I suppose not.

638
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:32,808
You suppose not?!

639
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,345
Why is it you find yourself an orphan?

640
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:38,080
It happened when I was an infant.

641
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:41,750
I'd like to know the circumstances,
if you've a mind to tell them.

642
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,419
I don't mind telling stories.

643
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,422
"Somewhere in a far-off land,

644
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:49,091
in a place whose name I
do not care to remember,

645
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:51,427
a gentleman lived not long ago,

646
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:55,131
one of those with a lance
and ancient shield on a shelf

647
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,392
who keeps a skinny nag and
a greyhound for racing..."

648
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,599
How dare you?

649
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:00,860
- What?
- Do you take me for a fool?

650
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:03,005
It's just it's a much
better story than mine.

651
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,740
I didn't ask for any
story, I asked for yours.

652
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:08,643
If you can't tell the truth,
then I have no time for you.

653
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:11,179
If you'll let me tell you
what I imagine about myself,

654
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:13,081
you'll find it ever so
much more interesting.

655
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:16,486
Wishing something is different
than it is will not make it so.

656
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:20,821
Truer words were never spoken.

657
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:27,294
My parents were Walter
and Bertha Shirley.

658
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:32,332
They were newlyweds, and
they were poor as church mice.

659
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:35,803
They died of a fever when
I was three months old.

660
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,839
So I've been earning my keep
for as long as I can remember.

661
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:42,977
And... I suppose I was
lucky that I was placed out

662
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:45,379
instead of staying in the asylum.

663
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,849
I never understood it.

664
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:55,149
If children are such a burden, then
why do people have so many of them?

665
00:40:57,573 --> 00:41:01,629
Nevertheless... it's a shame
I'll never have the opportunity.

666
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,274
What do you mean?

667
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:07,016
To be one.

668
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:12,505
- [neighing]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

669
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,574
- Ah!
- [barking]

670
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,386
Anne!

671
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,916
No! Go home!

672
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:21,081
Go home!

673
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:22,782
[whimpering]

674
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:24,850
Oh, my Lord!

675
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:26,987
Are you all right?

676
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:29,395
- Shhh.
- Oh, dear Lord!

677
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,390
- I'm fine. Here you are.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

678
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:33,827
Shhh. It's all right.
It's all right, Belle.

679
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:36,257
There's no need to worry anymore, Belle.

680
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,598
- Belle?
- That's her name.

681
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,068
Wasn't that an adventure?

682
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,802
Wasn't it just.

683
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,804
[Anne laughing]

684
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,356
- You're sure you're all right?
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,173
Oh.

686
00:41:54,631 --> 00:41:56,410
You were very level-headed.

687
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,244
I'm used to a ruckus.

688
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:01,154
[clicking]

689
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,759
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [Belle chuffing]

690
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:21,493
My, my, you're the last
folks I was looking for today,

691
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,322
but I'm real glad to see you.

692
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,127
And how are you doing, dear Anne?

693
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,296
I'm well enough, thank you.

694
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:29,498
What brings you by, Miss Cuthbert?

695
00:42:29,532 --> 00:42:31,132
The fact is, Mrs. Spencer,

696
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:33,545
there's been a queer mistake somewhere

697
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,255
and I've come over to see where it is.

698
00:42:36,006 --> 00:42:39,941
Matthew and I sent word for you
to bring us a boy from the asylum.

699
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,145
We told your brother Robert
to tell you we wanted a boy.

700
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:45,613
Marilla Cuthbert, you don't say so.

701
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,998
Why, Robert sent word through his
daughter Nancy

702
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,813
that you wanted a girl.

703
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:52,520
Oh, that Nancy is a
terrible flighty thing.

704
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:55,088
I've often had to scold
her for her heedlessness.

705
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:57,325
I'm dreadfully sorry about this.

706
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,653
It was our own fault.

707
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:00,540
We should've come to you ourselves,

708
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:03,705
and not left an important message
to be handed along by word of mouth.

709
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:06,016
However, the mistake has been made and

710
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,101
the only thing to do is to set it right.

711
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:11,222
I suppose the asylum will
take her back, won't they?

712
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:13,140
I suppose.

713
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:15,576
But it might not be
necessary to return her.

714
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:17,812
My neighbour, Mrs. Blewett,
was just saying to me

715
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:20,511
she's overburdened by her large family

716
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:23,029
and she wishes she'd
sent for a girl to help.

717
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:24,952
Anne will do nicely.

718
00:43:24,987 --> 00:43:27,720
I call this positively providential.

719
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:30,763
We'll call on her and
see. I'm sure she'll agree.

720
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:32,253
[crying]

721
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,288
How old are you and what's your name?

722
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,299
Anne Shirley. I'm just 13.

723
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:42,332
Hmm. You don't look as if there's
much to you. But you're wiry.

724
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,505
I dunno, but the wiry ones
are the best after all.

725
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:49,883
If I take you, you'll do as I
say and speak when spoken to.

726
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:52,069
I don't suffer no backtalk,
and if I find you lacking,

727
00:43:52,094 --> 00:43:53,947
you'll know the toe of my boot.

728
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,416
I expect you to earn
your keep, and no mistake.

729
00:43:56,452 --> 00:43:59,752
I'm at my wits' end with this
one. He'll be the death of me.

730
00:43:59,788 --> 00:44:01,221
[wailing]

731
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:03,957
That's a colic cry.

732
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:05,955
What?

733
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:08,828
He'll do better if you swaddle him.

734
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:11,364
And... gripe water helps.

735
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,462
Anne has worked for
large families before.

736
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:17,242
And work she will. This
ain't no charity house.

737
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:20,107
Well, I suppose I can take her
off your hands, Miss Cuthbert.

738
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:22,002
If you like, I can take her right now.

739
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:27,255
Well, I... I don't know. I...

740
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,836
I didn't say Matthew and I

741
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,151
had absolutely decided
we wouldn't keep her.

742
00:44:32,388 --> 00:44:35,731
I just came over to find out
how the mistake had occurred.

743
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:40,026
I'd better take her home again
and talk it over with my brother.

744
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:42,941
I ought not to decide on
anything without consulting him.

745
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:47,333
If we make up our minds not to keep
her, we'll send her over to you.

746
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:51,337
Otherwise, you can assume
that she'll be staying with us.

747
00:44:52,138 --> 00:44:53,839
Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?

748
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,048
- I suppose it'll have to.
- Very well.

749
00:44:57,073 --> 00:44:58,944
- [baby crying]
- Good day.

750
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,916
- [crying]
- [barking]

751
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:06,426
Oh, Miss Cuthbert,
did you really just say

752
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:08,654
that perhaps you'd let
me stay at Green Gables,

753
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:10,615
or did I only imagine that you did?

754
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:12,865
Yes, I did say that and no more.

755
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:15,647
But it isn't decided yet
and perhaps we'll conclude

756
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:18,149
that Mrs. Blewett should
take you after all.

757
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:21,092
I'd rather go back to the
asylum than live with her.

758
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:27,724
I keep expecting her to chase
after us on a broomstick.

759
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:31,395
I would like you to hold
your tongue on the ride home.

760
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:33,763
I've got plenty to think about.

761
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:43,481
[whinnying]

762
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:48,111
[soft music]

763
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,354
I'll thank you to keep
your questions to yourself

764
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:00,722
until we can speak in private.

765
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:02,946
Run along inside.

766
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,527
Put your bag upstairs
and put the kettle on.

767
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,094
Yes, Miss Cuthbert.

768
00:46:09,703 --> 00:46:11,935
Wipe that silly grin off your face.

769
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:17,440
I wouldn't give a dog I
liked to that Blewett woman.

770
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:20,777
Trouble is, I don't
know about keeping her.

771
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:23,055
She's an interesting little thing.

772
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,248
More to the point if she
was a useful little thing.

773
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,585
I propose we give her a one-week
trial to see how she behaves.

774
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,454
She has five days.

775
00:46:31,937 --> 00:46:34,626
I'll need a lot of
convincing, that's for certain.

776
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:35,785
[cow lowing]

777
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:38,537
Oh, for Heaven's sake.

778
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,363
- [crickets chirring]
- [owl hooting]

779
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:44,846
I noticed last night that
you threw your clothes

780
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,772
all about the floor
when you took them off.

781
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,873
That is a very untidy
habit and I can't allow it.

782
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:54,855
You must fold your clothing
neatly and place it on the chair.

783
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,652
I haven't any use for
little girls who aren't neat.

784
00:46:58,263 --> 00:47:00,048
I was so harrowed up
in my mind last night,

785
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:02,350
I didn't think about my clothes at all.

786
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,052
I'll fold them nicely tonight.

787
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,111
Although I have been known to forget.

788
00:47:07,136 --> 00:47:09,569
I'm usually in such a
hurry to finally get to bed.

789
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:12,094
Well, you'll have to remember
if you're going to stay here.

790
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,295
You understand that
you're on trial, yes?

791
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:17,561
Yes.

792
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:19,734
A decision will be made in one week.

793
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:25,116
Now... say your prayers
and get into bed.

794
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,041
I never say any prayers.

795
00:47:28,038 --> 00:47:28,967
What?!

796
00:47:29,874 --> 00:47:31,905
I said them at the asylum Sunday school.

797
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,729
I liked the catechism.

798
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:37,070
There's something splendid
about some of the words,

799
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:39,454
"infinite and unchangeable."

800
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,657
It's not quite poetry, but it
sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?

801
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:47,283
We're not talking about poetry,
Anne, we're talking about prayers!

802
00:47:47,858 --> 00:47:49,396
Don't you know it's a
terrible wicked thing

803
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:51,632
not to say your prayers every night?

804
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:55,080
I'm sorry, I was never
taught to say them.

805
00:47:55,491 --> 00:47:57,638
You must say your prayers
while you're under my roof.

806
00:47:57,673 --> 00:48:01,032
Of course, if you want me to.
I'd do anything to oblige you.

807
00:48:02,624 --> 00:48:05,379
But you'll have to tell me how
to say them for just this once.

808
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:08,549
You must kneel down.

809
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,522
Why must people kneel down to pray?

810
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:16,794
If I really wanted to pray,
I'll tell you what I'd do.

811
00:48:18,557 --> 00:48:20,988
I'd go into a great big field,

812
00:48:21,013 --> 00:48:22,362
all alone,

813
00:48:23,282 --> 00:48:26,509
or into the deep, deep woods,

814
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:29,702
and I'd look up into the sky, up-up-up,

815
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:32,872
into that lovely blue sky without end,

816
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:36,806
and I would just feel a prayer.

817
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,429
Well, I'm ready.

818
00:48:40,594 --> 00:48:41,688
What am I to say?

819
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:44,083
You're old enough to pray for yourself.

820
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:48,563
Just... thank God for your blessings

821
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:52,141
and ask Him humbly for
the things that you want.

822
00:48:52,582 --> 00:48:53,781
I'll do my best.

823
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:57,976
[sighing] Gracious heavenly Father...

824
00:48:58,998 --> 00:49:00,631
That's what ministers say in church,

825
00:49:00,658 --> 00:49:03,225
so I suppose it's all
right for private prayer?

826
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:10,379
Gracious heavenly Father...

827
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:13,412
...I thank Thee for
the White Way of Delight

828
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:15,847
and the Lake of Shining Waters,

829
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:17,849
and for dear Belle,

830
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:20,185
and the lovely Snow Queen.

831
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:23,055
I'm really extremely grateful for them.

832
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:27,526
And that's all the blessings I can
think of just now to thank Thee for.

833
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,322
And as for things I
want, they're so numerous

834
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,696
that it would take me a great
deal of time to name them all,

835
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:35,499
so I shall only mention
the two most important.

836
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:39,110
Please let me stay at Green Gables,

837
00:49:39,955 --> 00:49:42,407
please let me be
good-looking when I grow up.

838
00:49:43,602 --> 00:49:45,910
Yours respectfully, Anne Shirley.

839
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,087
There.

840
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:51,650
Did I do it all right?

841
00:49:52,195 --> 00:49:53,548
That'll do for now.

842
00:49:54,243 --> 00:49:55,976
Get into bed, child.

843
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:01,567
Oh! I just realized I
should've said "Amen"

844
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:04,960
in place of "yours respectfully"
the way ministers do?

845
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:07,397
Do you suppose it'll
make any difference?

846
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,067
- I don't suppose it will.
- As God is my witness,

847
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:12,327
I will do everything in my earthly power

848
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:14,239
to make you want to keep me.

849
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:15,488
Good night.

850
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,997
God, give me strength
to succeed in my quest!

851
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:20,086
- That will do.
- Sorry.

852
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:22,557
I quite like praying.

853
00:50:22,582 --> 00:50:24,505
Well, it's time to say good night.

854
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,268
Good night.

855
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:46,403
[sighing]

856
00:50:50,513 --> 00:50:52,978
That girl's next door
to a perfect heathen.

857
00:50:57,404 --> 00:51:00,405
God only knows what we're
getting ourselves into.

858
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:08,145
[rooster crowing]

859
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,036
[cattle lowing]

860
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:14,976
Anne?!

861
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:23,741
Anne!

862
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:38,948
She's gone!

863
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:42,041
- Gone?
- I'll check the silverware.

864
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:45,314
[clucking]

865
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:49,669
Eggs! That's one chore done!

866
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:51,211
Now I've met all the chickens,

867
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,839
so you don't need to
make any introductions!

868
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:54,541
I've been up since before the sun.

869
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:56,608
I was too excited to sleep.

870
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:59,712
And I wanted to start proving
to you that I should stay.

871
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:02,348
It's so easy to love
Green Gables, isn't it?

872
00:52:02,383 --> 00:52:05,017
I'll let the milkers out to graze.

873
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,019
I'll have breakfast on soon.

874
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,930
May I take these blossoms up to my room?

875
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:09,725
No.

876
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:13,092
You don't want your room or your
person cluttered up with flowers.

877
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:15,261
You should've left them on
the tree in the first place.

878
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:16,829
I felt a little that way, too.

879
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:19,465
I felt I shouldn't shorten their
lovely lives by picking them.

880
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,195
I mean, I wouldn't want to
be picked if I were a blossom.

881
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:24,352
Wouldn't it be lovely to be a blossom?

882
00:52:24,387 --> 00:52:27,054
Yesterday, you wanted to be a seagull.

883
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:31,629
And the power and the glory forever.

884
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:33,194
Amen. [laughing]

885
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:35,003
I like this prayer.

886
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,861
It's lovely.

887
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,699
Our Father, who art in heaven,

888
00:52:38,734 --> 00:52:40,434
hallowed be Thy name!

889
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:44,056
It's like a line of music.

890
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:46,874
Just get on with the
business of learning it.

891
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:49,436
"Our Father, who art in heaven"...

892
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:51,291
Regardless of the outcome here,

893
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:53,350
you should have something to wear

894
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,224
besides that flimsy bit of business.

895
00:52:56,491 --> 00:53:00,108
I have a leftover piece of cotton
on a bolt that may do nicely.

896
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:05,945
You're going to make me a dress?

897
00:53:06,271 --> 00:53:08,472
You need something
suitable that fits you.

898
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:12,275
A new dress! I've never
had a new dress. Not ever.

899
00:53:12,311 --> 00:53:15,544
I can't wait to have puff
sleeves and ever so many flounces!

900
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:18,748
Do you think you can adorn it with
lace at the cuff and neckline, too?

901
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:20,984
I don't believe in frills or flounces.

902
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:25,021
But surely you don't mind puff
sleeves? All the girls are wearing them.

903
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:27,358
Puff sleeves are divine.

904
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:28,992
Waste of fabric.

905
00:53:29,261 --> 00:53:30,361
Oh.

906
00:53:30,396 --> 00:53:34,498
Well, I'm sure if it's a lovely
azure blue or willow green,

907
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:36,653
I'm sure I won't mind if it's...

908
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:38,405
plain.

909
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:40,394
You're a vain one and no mistake.

910
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:43,250
Brown is a very sensible colour.

911
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:46,859
I'll need your dress so I
can use it for a pattern.

912
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,031
Let's take these things off now.

913
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,526
Thank you, Miss Cuthbert.

914
00:53:51,551 --> 00:53:54,152
I'm very grateful to have
something new, really I am.

915
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,977
I'm sure I can imagine it's fashionable.

916
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:58,923
It shouldn't take me about a day or two.

917
00:54:00,813 --> 00:54:02,388
If it looks just like this one,

918
00:54:02,896 --> 00:54:04,732
it shouldn't take you any time at all.

919
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:08,032
You run along now, and learn the prayer.

920
00:54:09,011 --> 00:54:10,336
Yes, Miss Cuthbert.

921
00:54:11,404 --> 00:54:14,138
"Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be..."

922
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:16,874
Puff sleeves!

923
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:26,359
Good morning, Marilla.

924
00:54:26,395 --> 00:54:27,711
Good morning, Rachel.

925
00:54:28,237 --> 00:54:29,890
I brought you some scones.

926
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,335
I felt sure you wouldn't
have time for baking,

927
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,626
- what with all the hubbub.
- Thank you.

928
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:38,096
I'll just come in and
sit a spell, shall I?

929
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:39,831
Catch my breath.

930
00:54:47,474 --> 00:54:50,775
I've been hearing some surprising
things about you and Matthew.

931
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:54,445
I don't suppose you're any
more surprised than I am myself.

932
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,138
What an incredible mistake.

933
00:54:58,192 --> 00:54:59,417
The mind reels.

934
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:03,054
Couldn't you have just sent her back?

935
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,723
We may yet,

936
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:07,598
but for now, she's here on trial.

937
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,527
Trial?

938
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:10,895
One week.

939
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:13,220
Matthew is quite set on keeping her.

940
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:15,934
And I'll admit she's
a bright little thing.

941
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,446
But I'll need a great
deal more convincing.

942
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:21,472
I know it by heart, Miss Cuthbert!

943
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:26,309
Anne, this is our neighbour, Mrs. Lynde.

944
00:55:27,213 --> 00:55:30,353
Well, they didn't pick
you for your looks,

945
00:55:30,378 --> 00:55:32,144
that's sure and certain.

946
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:36,653
She's terribly skinny
and homely, Marilla.

947
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:38,588
[Rachel chuckling]

948
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,591
All elbows and knees. [laughing]

949
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:44,170
And did you ever see such freckles?

950
00:55:44,626 --> 00:55:47,497
And hair as red as
carrots. Dear, dear me.

951
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:49,699
I hate you.

952
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:52,870
- Anne.
- I hate you. I hate you, I hate you!!

953
00:55:52,905 --> 00:55:55,336
- Anne!
- How dare you call me skinny and ugly?!

954
00:55:55,361 --> 00:55:58,041
How dare you call me
freckled and redheaded?!

955
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:01,361
- You are a rude, unfeeling woman!
- Well!

956
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:03,946
How would you like to have
such things said about you?!

957
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:07,183
How would you like to be told
that you're fat and clumsy

958
00:56:07,218 --> 00:56:10,541
and probably hadn't a spark
of imagination in you?!

959
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:14,123
And I don't care if I hurt
your feelings by saying so.

960
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:16,725
I hope I hurt them!

961
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:18,127
Because you have hurt my feelings

962
00:56:18,152 --> 00:56:20,399
worse than they have
ever been hurt before,

963
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:24,463
and I will never forgive
you for this! Never, never!!!

964
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,362
Anne!

965
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,491
Come back here!

966
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:31,949
Anne!

967
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:44,313
Well...

968
00:56:44,955 --> 00:56:46,163
I never.

969
00:56:47,424 --> 00:56:49,391
It's a good thing you can send her back.

970
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:51,626
I wouldn't envy you the
job of bringing that up.

971
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:53,695
You shouldn't have twitted
her about her looks, Rachel.

972
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,628
Marilla Cuthbert...

973
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,068
...you don't mean to tell
me that you are upholding her

974
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:03,898
in such a terrible display
of temper as we've just seen?

975
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:07,929
I am not trying to excuse
her. She has been very naughty,

976
00:57:08,382 --> 00:57:10,377
and I'll have to give
her a talking-to about it.

977
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,015
But we must make allowances for her.

978
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:14,929
She's never been taught what is right.

979
00:57:15,493 --> 00:57:17,116
And you were too hard on her, Rachel.

980
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,952
Well...

981
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:21,397
I can see now

982
00:57:21,422 --> 00:57:23,857
I'm going to have to be very
careful what I say after this

983
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:26,193
since the fine feelings of orphans,

984
00:57:26,229 --> 00:57:28,162
brought from goodness knows where,

985
00:57:28,197 --> 00:57:31,031
have to be considered
before anything else.

986
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,933
- Now, now...
- Oh, no, no.

987
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,615
I'm not vexed.

988
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:37,675
Don't worry yourself.

989
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:42,167
I feel too sorry for you to
have any anger left in my mind.

990
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:46,815
But if you will take my advice
you will have that "talking-to"

991
00:57:46,856 --> 00:57:49,548
with a fair-sized birch switch,

992
00:57:50,043 --> 00:57:52,018
and get her on the next train out.

993
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,750
Goodbye, Marilla.

994
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:06,399
[panting]

995
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,982
[seagulls squawking]

996
00:58:43,999 --> 00:58:45,475
It's been quite a swell.

997
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,099
She'll make her own way home.

998
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,052
I could go...

999
00:58:50,077 --> 00:58:53,225
She's in her under things,
so she's gotta come back.

1000
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:55,995
The girl needs to learn some sense.

1001
00:58:56,615 --> 00:58:57,863
I'm sorry.

1002
00:58:57,898 --> 00:58:59,323
I shouldn't have lost my temper and

1003
00:58:59,348 --> 00:59:01,033
embarrassed you in front of Mrs. Lynde.

1004
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:03,635
- I hope you can forgive me.
- Are you all right?

1005
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,604
- Yes.
- I'm sorry for worrying you.

1006
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,007
I needed time to ponder.

1007
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,877
If you let me stay, I'll do my very best

1008
00:59:12,912 --> 00:59:15,583
not to fly into another
temper ever again.

1009
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:17,903
I appreciate that you're contrite, Anne,

1010
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:21,953
but the person that you owe
the apology to is Mrs. Lynde.

1011
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,789
But she hadn't any right to
call me ugly and redheaded!

1012
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:26,924
You say it yourself often enough.

1013
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,078
But there's such a
difference between saying

1014
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:31,437
a thing yourself and
hearing other people say it!

1015
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:33,520
You need to learn discipline.

1016
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:35,851
Just magine how you would
feel if someone told you

1017
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,969
to your face that you
were skinny and ugly.

1018
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:40,871
Remember when we were young,
Marilla, and old lady Adams said...

1019
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:42,540
- Yes.
- You were gawky...

1020
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:44,941
Yes. Thank you. I recall
you suffered from it.

1021
00:59:44,977 --> 00:59:47,209
I don't say that Mrs. Lynde was exactly

1022
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:49,547
right in saying what
she did to you, Anne.

1023
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:52,327
- She's too outspoken...
- She's a bully.

1024
00:59:52,683 --> 00:59:55,639
But that is no excuse for
such behaviour on your part.

1025
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:59,430
You were rude and saucy and
you must go to Mrs. Lynde

1026
00:59:59,455 --> 01:00:01,625
and tell her that you're sorry
and ask her to forgive you.

1027
01:00:03,116 --> 01:00:06,311
I could never do that.
Punish me any way you like.

1028
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,742
Shut me up in a dark, damp
dungeon and I shan't complain,

1029
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:12,312
but I cannot ask Mrs.
Lynde to forgive me!

1030
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:16,739
We're not in the habit of
shutting people up in dungeons.

1031
01:00:17,058 --> 01:00:19,042
But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must.

1032
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,393
And you'll stay up in your room

1033
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:23,533
until you can tell me that
you're willing to do it.

1034
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:25,353
I'll have to stay up
there forever, then,

1035
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:28,970
because I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm
sorry I said those things to her.

1036
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,479
How can I?

1037
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:32,341
I'm not sorry.

1038
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:34,087
I'm sorry I vexed you,

1039
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:36,759
but I'm glad I told her just what I did.

1040
01:00:37,244 --> 01:00:39,128
It was a great satisfaction.

1041
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:44,022
In fact, I can't even imagine...

1042
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:45,702
that I'm sorry.

1043
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:46,998
Well, let's hope your imagination

1044
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:49,105
is in better working order by morning.

1045
01:00:56,143 --> 01:00:58,814
You can't send her back over this.

1046
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:00,932
Don't be so sure.

1047
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:02,884
Oh, it's...

1048
01:01:03,815 --> 01:01:07,256
it's good that, uh...
Rachel got a calling-down.

1049
01:01:09,408 --> 01:01:10,688
Wish I'd been there.

1050
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:13,094
Matthew Cuthbert, I'm astonished at you.

1051
01:01:14,744 --> 01:01:16,415
And you'll take her up a meal?

1052
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,568
When did you ever hear of me
starving people into good behaviour?

1053
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,902
But she'll stay up there until she's

1054
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:23,772
willing to apologize and that is final!

1055
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:25,774
[crickets chirring]

1056
01:01:32,582 --> 01:01:34,315
[soft music]

1057
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:05,946
[seagulls squawking]

1058
01:02:13,555 --> 01:02:15,923
[crickets chirring]

1059
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:18,358
[soft music]

1060
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:29,226
How's by you, Anne?

1061
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:32,002
I'm fairly well, thank you.

1062
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,956
I imagine a good deal, so
that helps pass the time.

1063
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:42,748
Don't you think you'd
better... say it... and just...

1064
01:02:43,481 --> 01:02:44,644
have it over with?

1065
01:02:45,339 --> 01:02:47,245
If I apologize, I'll be fibbing.

1066
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:50,857
Hmm.

1067
01:02:51,285 --> 01:02:53,685
It'll have to be done...

1068
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:55,629
sooner or later,

1069
01:02:55,664 --> 01:02:57,674
for Marilla's a...

1070
01:02:58,472 --> 01:03:00,467
a dreadful determined woman.

1071
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:02,135
Dreadful determined.

1072
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,192
So am I.

1073
01:03:10,178 --> 01:03:11,811
It's, uh...

1074
01:03:11,846 --> 01:03:14,041
it's terrible lonesome downstairs...

1075
01:03:14,515 --> 01:03:15,623
without you.

1076
01:03:17,454 --> 01:03:19,385
I'm not used to the quiet anymore.

1077
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,820
The trouble is, the
prospect seems humiliating.

1078
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,489
And unfair.

1079
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,180
But you're smart enough...

1080
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,716
...to find the right
words, I'm sure of it.

1081
01:03:29,741 --> 01:03:31,810
But why should the apology
have to come from me

1082
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:34,770
when it was Mrs. Lynde who
caused the entire situation?

1083
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:36,451
Well, you know...

1084
01:03:38,512 --> 01:03:40,398
I like to think that...

1085
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:43,175
...that one fine day,

1086
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,278
it won't matter a whit to you

1087
01:03:45,678 --> 01:03:47,811
what anybody says sideways.

1088
01:03:49,049 --> 01:03:51,049
You have a good imagination.

1089
01:03:54,321 --> 01:03:56,955
I suppose it would be true
enough to say I'm sorry.

1090
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,162
I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla.

1091
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:00,717
And you.

1092
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:05,767
So go and smooth things over, can't you?

1093
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,670
Very well. I'll attempt it.

1094
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:14,581
For you.

1095
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:17,822
Now, that's good news.

1096
01:04:24,516 --> 01:04:27,784
Don't tell Marilla
we had a conversation,

1097
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,622
on account of we decided
raising you was her department.

1098
01:04:34,307 --> 01:04:36,674
I shall carry our secret to my grave.

1099
01:04:48,074 --> 01:04:49,840
[birdsong]

1100
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,847
Whatever are you thinking, Anne,

1101
01:04:52,498 --> 01:04:54,565
I hope you're taking this seriously.

1102
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,780
Oh, I am.

1103
01:04:55,814 --> 01:04:58,364
I'm imagining out what
I must say to Mrs. Lynde.

1104
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:11,118
Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry!

1105
01:05:11,143 --> 01:05:12,996
I could never express my sorrow, no,

1106
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:15,064
not even if I used
up a whole dictionary.

1107
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,641
I behaved terribly to you,

1108
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:19,205
and I've disgraced my
dear friends the Cuthberts,

1109
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:22,213
who may let me stay at Green
Gables even though I'm not a boy!

1110
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:24,711
I am a dreadfully wicked
and ungrateful girl,

1111
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:26,727
and I deserve to be punished and

1112
01:05:26,752 --> 01:05:28,732
cast out by respectable society forever!

1113
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:31,200
It was awful of me to fly into a temper

1114
01:05:31,251 --> 01:05:33,511
because you told me the truth.

1115
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:36,903
And it was the truth. Every
word you said was true.

1116
01:05:36,928 --> 01:05:40,817
<i>My hair is red and I am
freckled and skinny and ugly!</i>

1117
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:43,786
Now, what I said to you was true,
too, but I shouldn't have said it!

1118
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:47,078
Oh, Mrs. Lynde, please,
please say you can forgive me!

1119
01:05:47,703 --> 01:05:48,883
If you refuse,

1120
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:52,896
oh, it'll be a lifelong sorrow
on a poor little orphan girl.

1121
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:55,465
Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde!

1122
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,167
There, there. Get up, child.

1123
01:05:59,408 --> 01:06:00,703
Of course I forgive you.

1124
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:03,872
I guess I was a little hard on you,

1125
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,734
but I'm just an outspoken person.

1126
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:07,476
You mustn't mind me, that's what I say.

1127
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:09,878
Thank you for your kind consideration.

1128
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:13,748
I look forward to never
minding what you say again.

1129
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,154
Indeed.

1130
01:06:18,956 --> 01:06:21,823
Although it can't be denied
your hair is terrible red.

1131
01:06:22,383 --> 01:06:24,193
But there may be hope for it.

1132
01:06:24,228 --> 01:06:26,962
There was a girl in
our class who had hair

1133
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:29,831
every bit as red as yours.
Do you recall, Marilla?

1134
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:31,500
But when she grew up,

1135
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:34,723
it darkened to a real handsome auburn.

1136
01:06:35,176 --> 01:06:37,305
I wouldn't be a mite
surprised if yours did, too.

1137
01:06:37,963 --> 01:06:40,142
Oh, Mrs. Lynde, you've given me hope!

1138
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:43,011
I shall always remember
that you are a benefactor...

1139
01:06:43,046 --> 01:06:44,803
We should run along, Rachel.

1140
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,325
Thank you for your graciousness.

1141
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,420
Of course.

1142
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:01,015
She has a queer way
of expressing herself.

1143
01:07:01,335 --> 01:07:02,907
Forcible-like.

1144
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:05,569
I apologized pretty well, didn't I?

1145
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:08,802
I thought since I had to do it,
I might as well do it thoroughly.

1146
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:11,536
You did it thoroughly, all right.

1147
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,021
I hope you'll try to control
your temper better in the future.

1148
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:18,065
I will. I absolutely will.

1149
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:22,021
Although apologizing is
my new favourite thing.

1150
01:07:22,187 --> 01:07:23,250
[laughing]

1151
01:07:24,794 --> 01:07:27,371
I'm going to prove myself
worthy of staying, Miss Cuthbert.

1152
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:29,184
I've been making a list in my head

1153
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,285
of all the ways I might
be useful to you both.

1154
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,222
And in addition to the indoor chores,

1155
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,362
I'm sure I can help with
the outdoor chores, too.

1156
01:07:35,396 --> 01:07:37,997
I'm much stronger than
I look. It isn't too...

1157
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,838
You hired a boy?

1158
01:07:43,595 --> 01:07:45,479
But I haven't even
finished my trial yet.

1159
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:47,855
There's work needs
to be done either way.

1160
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:01,361
How long will you be here?

1161
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:04,844
<i>Allô. You must be Anne.</i>

1162
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:07,996
- With an E.
- <i>Je m'appelle Jerry.</i>

1163
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:10,134
Jerry Baynard. Nice to meet you.

1164
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:13,070
Baynard. Foolhardy.

1165
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:14,308
<i>Pardon?</i>

1166
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:17,321
Your surname means
reckless or foolhardy.

1167
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:20,514
Charlemagne even named his
impossible horse Baynard.

1168
01:08:22,318 --> 01:08:24,518
I don't know him... Charlemagne.

1169
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:27,622
Of course you don't. He
died hundreds of years ago.

1170
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:32,960
- So you living here now?
- Yes.

1171
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:35,528
Probably. I... I don't know!

1172
01:08:35,564 --> 01:08:36,509
Pretty here.

1173
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:38,615
You're lucky.

1174
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,177
I don't remember you
from the orphanage...

1175
01:08:41,224 --> 01:08:43,825
No, no, I live in town. Big family.

1176
01:08:43,932 --> 01:08:45,804
We have a small shop,
but with so many...

1177
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:48,013
some of us must work.

1178
01:08:48,038 --> 01:08:50,153
Well, if you come from
such a large family,

1179
01:08:50,178 --> 01:08:51,732
it may trouble your conscience

1180
01:08:51,757 --> 01:08:54,336
to know that you are
displacing my own position

1181
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:56,798
in my very first potential family.

1182
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:59,366
I am hired through harvest, so...

1183
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:02,913
I don't think the Cuthberts
will need you if I stay.

1184
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,671
In fact, if you hand me your pitchfork,

1185
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,573
I'll be happy to finish your task.

1186
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:09,249
- What's your problem?
- You.

1187
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,477
You're my problem.

1188
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:16,583
All I'm doing is my job.

1189
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:18,508
What are you supposed to be doing?

1190
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:42,876
[coughing]

1191
01:09:58,433 --> 01:10:00,939
My apology was an unmitigated success.

1192
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:02,429
Mrs. Lynde was very pleased.

1193
01:10:02,858 --> 01:10:05,465
It's not Rachel Lynde that
you need to worry about.

1194
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:08,925
Well, Miss Cuthbert seemed pleased, too.

1195
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:11,188
Now you're talking.

1196
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:16,699
It'll ease Marilla's mind...

1197
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:18,944
that I've got help.

1198
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:25,284
Matthew... are you sure
you still want me to stay?

1199
01:10:36,597 --> 01:10:38,194
The thing of it is,

1200
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:40,807
and Marilla won't admit this,

1201
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:43,535
but she's getting older, too.

1202
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,312
I'll go right in!

1203
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,287
That's a good idea.

1204
01:10:50,733 --> 01:10:51,781
Hey, hey.

1205
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:09,193
- Good day to you, Matthew.
- William.

1206
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:12,369
Checking the perimeter?
Anything I should know about?

1207
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:16,167
I wanted to talk to you
about your new... acquisition.

1208
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:18,059
New?

1209
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:20,871
The orphan girl from Nova Scotia.

1210
01:11:24,832 --> 01:11:27,591
Word in town has it that
you're keeping the girl.

1211
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:29,577
Well...

1212
01:11:30,231 --> 01:11:32,332
we're pretty well decided,
that's true enough.

1213
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:35,700
I wonder if Marilla and
the girl could come to call.

1214
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:37,402
Her name's Anne.

1215
01:11:38,605 --> 01:11:39,536
The girl.

1216
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,061
And that's... that's
real neighbourly of you.

1217
01:11:42,193 --> 01:11:45,461
Uh, I'm guessing that
she and your Diana...

1218
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,200
they're about the same age.

1219
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:51,300
Before we permit our children
to associate with your "Anne,"

1220
01:11:51,336 --> 01:11:53,601
my wife and I need to assure ourselves

1221
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:55,395
that she won't corrupt
their good natures

1222
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,021
or exert any negative influence.

1223
01:11:58,046 --> 01:11:59,946
I'm sure you can understand.

1224
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,514
Oh, I... I understand.

1225
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:06,065
Very good.

1226
01:12:06,951 --> 01:12:09,452
- Afternoon tea tomorrow?
- Tea tomorrow.

1227
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:13,138
Excellent. Good day to you.

1228
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:20,428
You've got an invitation to tea...

1229
01:12:20,464 --> 01:12:22,364
tomorrow afternoon.

1230
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:24,595
Barry's.

1231
01:12:25,706 --> 01:12:27,405
They want to meet Anne.

1232
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:29,907
I haven't finished the dress.

1233
01:12:29,932 --> 01:12:32,070
She can't go wearing
that. Oh, my heavens.

1234
01:12:32,095 --> 01:12:34,376
Who are the Barrys and why
do they want to meet me?

1235
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,785
Our neighbours. A very
respectable family.

1236
01:12:38,482 --> 01:12:42,189
Hem. Buttons. You'll want
to be on your best behaviour.

1237
01:12:42,214 --> 01:12:43,214
But why?

1238
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:46,246
They have two little
girls who are very well-mannered.

1239
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:51,859
Do they... need help?

1240
01:12:53,128 --> 01:12:54,829
Diana is the girl...

1241
01:12:54,864 --> 01:12:57,698
- nearest your age.
- If you stay here,

1242
01:12:57,733 --> 01:13:00,334
perhaps you two will become friends.

1243
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:04,138
A real friend.

1244
01:13:04,774 --> 01:13:06,908
<i>Let go! Let go of me!</i>

1245
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:09,643
- Shut it! I mean it.
- [panting]

1246
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,144
[whimpering]

1247
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:15,419
Go get it.

1248
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:22,989
- Hold her down.
- Please... don't! Don't!

1249
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,858
Stop talking.

1250
01:13:28,499 --> 01:13:30,332
Guess what, Princess Cordelia.

1251
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:32,367
We're sick of you and
your stupid stories!

1252
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:33,934
- Stupid stories!
- Liar!

1253
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:36,169
[squealing]

1254
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:38,405
This little mousey made too much noise.

1255
01:13:38,441 --> 01:13:41,074
- Squeak squeak squeak...
- Squeak squeak squeak...

1256
01:13:41,109 --> 01:13:42,895
But then it got caught in a trap.

1257
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:46,646
So now... no more squeaking.

1258
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,718
So shut your face from now on.

1259
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:57,761
- Let's go.
- [laughter]

1260
01:14:09,437 --> 01:14:10,645
I'm so sorry.

1261
01:14:11,992 --> 01:14:13,806
Speak only when spoken to.

1262
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:15,882
No startling speeches.

1263
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:18,910
Anne? What's wrong?

1264
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:20,382
Are you ill?

1265
01:14:23,149 --> 01:14:24,750
No, Miss Cuthbert.

1266
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:27,952
I'm fine. Don't worry.

1267
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:30,671
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

1268
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:50,900
Um, I don't feel
nearly as squashed in it

1269
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:52,743
as I did in my old one.

1270
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,491
High praise indeed.

1271
01:14:55,154 --> 01:14:56,547
You've got room to grow.

1272
01:14:57,246 --> 01:14:58,983
It's so nice to be
wearing something new,

1273
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:01,360
I don't even mind not
having puff sleeves.

1274
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:06,024
This was mine as a girl,

1275
01:15:06,059 --> 01:15:08,010
so it's far from new...

1276
01:15:08,728 --> 01:15:10,226
but it'll do nicely.

1277
01:15:14,366 --> 01:15:15,375
Thank you.

1278
01:15:16,705 --> 01:15:17,933
It's so pretty.

1279
01:15:20,355 --> 01:15:23,813
You look clean and tidy,
and that's what counts.

1280
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:27,258
- Isn't this lovely.
- Hand it here.

1281
01:15:27,283 --> 01:15:29,731
- May I try it on?
- That is not a toy.

1282
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:34,259
This is a treasured possession.

1283
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,786
- Do you understand?
- I completely understand.

1284
01:15:37,134 --> 01:15:38,800
Amethyst is my favourite.

1285
01:15:39,139 --> 01:15:41,156
I think diamonds pale in comparison.

1286
01:15:41,181 --> 01:15:42,426
Do you now?

1287
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:45,162
Amethysts are so much more romantic.

1288
01:15:45,197 --> 01:15:48,368
This was my grandmother's.

1289
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:51,168
My mother bequeathed it to me.

1290
01:15:51,783 --> 01:15:53,116
Well, it's perfectly elegant.

1291
01:15:53,238 --> 01:15:55,005
Are you ready to go?

1292
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:57,539
- I'm not sure.
- What do you mean?

1293
01:15:57,575 --> 01:16:01,822
It's just... this is a meeting
of great auspiciousness.

1294
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:04,549
What if she doesn't like me?

1295
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:06,382
It's her mother you've
got to reckon with.

1296
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:08,558
If Mrs. Barry doesn't like you,

1297
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,769
it won't matter a wit
how much Diana does.

1298
01:16:14,976 --> 01:16:16,792
Whatever is the matter with you, child?

1299
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,827
You haven't said a word since
we left. You're not yourself.

1300
01:16:21,099 --> 01:16:22,287
Perfect.

1301
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,241
Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert.

1302
01:16:33,276 --> 01:16:35,210
Afternoon, Mrs. Barry.

1303
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:37,078
Please, call me Eliza.

1304
01:16:38,406 --> 01:16:40,806
And... this must be Anne.

1305
01:16:43,786 --> 01:16:44,986
Good afternoon.

1306
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,425
Good afternoon.

1307
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:52,727
Afternoon.

1308
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:55,930
Thank you for having us, Eliza.

1309
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,963
Marilla, Anne,

1310
01:16:58,617 --> 01:16:59,933
please come in.

1311
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,107
I don't believe you said
two words during tea.

1312
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:23,558
You didn't even remark on the cake.

1313
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:26,731
Mother let me help her bake it special.

1314
01:17:28,735 --> 01:17:30,368
You enjoyed it...

1315
01:17:30,403 --> 01:17:32,002
didn't you?

1316
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,426
The cake was scrumptious.

1317
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:39,010
Scrumptious. [chuckling]

1318
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:43,548
Have you always been shy,

1319
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,714
or does it come from being an orphan?

1320
01:17:46,752 --> 01:17:48,954
I'm less shy than reticent.

1321
01:17:49,953 --> 01:17:52,421
Goodness, there's another 25-cent word.

1322
01:17:53,693 --> 01:17:55,493
It's just...

1323
01:17:55,528 --> 01:17:56,503
Yes?

1324
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,772
I like to read. When I can.

1325
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:01,832
I like reading, too,

1326
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:04,701
but Mother prefers
that I do needlepoint.

1327
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,938
Does needlepoint provide much
scope for the imagination?

1328
01:18:09,412 --> 01:18:12,509
I don't think imagination
is my strong suit.

1329
01:18:12,544 --> 01:18:13,678
Really?

1330
01:18:14,379 --> 01:18:16,860
I don't know what I'd do without mine.

1331
01:18:18,049 --> 01:18:21,283
Life would be an agony.
An utter... agony.

1332
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,053
Agony. [chuckling]

1333
01:18:25,724 --> 01:18:27,790
I make up stories all the time.

1334
01:18:28,643 --> 01:18:30,228
I could never do that.

1335
01:18:32,364 --> 01:18:36,383
I like to imagine that I
am a princess in a tower.

1336
01:18:36,408 --> 01:18:38,467
Or Joan of Arc riding into battle!

1337
01:18:38,503 --> 01:18:40,936
Or a forlorn bride who lives by the sea

1338
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:42,871
but never speaks to anyone,

1339
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:45,207
because her one true love was lost

1340
01:18:45,243 --> 01:18:47,676
when his ship went down and disappeared

1341
01:18:47,711 --> 01:18:49,211
beneath the waves!

1342
01:18:49,632 --> 01:18:51,046
[Anne laughing]

1343
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,815
Wonderful. Could you
tell me a story now?

1344
01:18:53,851 --> 01:18:56,352
- I could tell you 12!
- [laughter]

1345
01:18:58,189 --> 01:18:59,327
Diana...

1346
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:03,168
do you think you could
like me just... a little?

1347
01:19:03,361 --> 01:19:05,027
I already do.

1348
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:09,496
Shall we swear to be best
friends forever and ever?

1349
01:19:11,002 --> 01:19:12,884
It's dreadfully wicked to swear.

1350
01:19:14,038 --> 01:19:17,338
No, it's not my kind of
swearing. There are two kinds.

1351
01:19:17,374 --> 01:19:19,808
I know because I have a worldly outlook.

1352
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,017
This kind isn't wicked at all.

1353
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:25,180
It means vowing and promising solemnly.

1354
01:19:25,215 --> 01:19:26,848
I swear it does.

1355
01:19:26,884 --> 01:19:27,806
See?

1356
01:19:32,056 --> 01:19:34,723
- How do you do it?
- Well...

1357
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:42,863
This ought to be done by
moonlight or over running water,

1358
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,365
but we'll just imagine
that it's night time

1359
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:47,968
and that this path is a stream.

1360
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:50,108
Hold this...

1361
01:19:51,005 --> 01:19:53,021
and twist your pinky finger around mine.

1362
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,203
I'll repeat the oath first.

1363
01:19:57,413 --> 01:19:59,246
I solemnly swear...

1364
01:19:59,281 --> 01:20:01,882
to be faithful to my
bosom friend, Diana Barry,

1365
01:20:01,918 --> 01:20:04,378
for as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.

1366
01:20:04,921 --> 01:20:07,027
And then she said it and put my name in.

1367
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:11,003
And then we sent our
oath into the world.

1368
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,207
Not in the...

1369
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:14,841
- [Marilla sighing.]
- Sorry. I'll collect them.

1370
01:20:15,956 --> 01:20:18,638
It was a wonderful
afternoon! I'm so relieved!

1371
01:20:19,785 --> 01:05:24,746
It seems you made a favorable
impression with the Barrys.

1372
01:20:23,221 --> 01:05:24,746
And Diana didn't mind my stories at all.

1373
01:20:25,382 --> 01:05:24,746
In fact, I told her two,

1374
01:20:26,887 --> 01:05:24,746
and we promised to make up another
the next time we're together.

1375
01:20:31,426 --> 01:05:24,746
Diana says she doesn't
have much imagination,

1376
01:20:33,494 --> 01:05:24,746
but I don't think it matters,

1377
01:20:35,460 --> 01:05:24,746
since I have enough for both of us.

1378
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:41,631
They're hosting a church picnic next week

1379
01:20:41,656 --> 01:20:43,299
at the Lake of Shining Waters.

1380
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:46,672
I've never been to a picnic.
Can we go, Miss Cuthbert?

1381
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:48,640
[sighing] We'll see.

1382
01:20:50,525 --> 01:20:52,468
Diana and I are kindred spirits.

1383
01:20:53,378 --> 01:20:56,213
And I think she'd be struck quite
sad if I were to be sent away.

1384
01:20:56,249 --> 01:20:59,684
Please take my shawl upstairs
and lay it neatly on my chair.

1385
01:21:00,646 --> 01:21:03,364
May I go outside after and
help Matthew with the cattle?

1386
01:21:03,389 --> 01:21:05,437
I can't wait to tell him everything!

1387
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:08,464
As long as you're helping and
not just flapping your gums.

1388
01:21:18,705 --> 01:21:20,705
[soft, enchanting music]

1389
01:21:28,777 --> 01:21:32,317
I'm sorry to arrive so late to
the ball, dear Prince Wisteria.

1390
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,689
One of my squires returned on
horseback after a harrowing journey...

1391
01:21:39,725 --> 01:21:41,691
and handed me a letter...

1392
01:21:42,174 --> 01:21:44,507
that required my urgent attention.

1393
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,767
So please, do not doubt my love.

1394
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:52,101
...and please, please let the
Cuthberts decide to keep me.

1395
01:21:52,137 --> 01:21:54,438
I realize now it's the
only thing I truly want,

1396
01:21:54,473 --> 01:21:57,140
so you don't have to worry
yourself about my red hair.

1397
01:21:57,175 --> 01:21:59,520
[chuckling] Amen.

1398
01:22:01,919 --> 01:22:03,518
Where is my brooch?

1399
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:06,382
- It should be there on your shawl.
- It is not.

1400
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:08,651
Nor is it in my jewellery box.

1401
01:22:09,379 --> 01:22:10,820
Did you take it?

1402
01:22:11,549 --> 01:22:13,355
I was playing with it,
but I didn't take it.

1403
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:16,459
- You were told not to touch it.
- I'm sorry.

1404
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:19,494
It's just it's so
beautiful, I couldn't resist.

1405
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:21,417
You were told to set
the shawl on the chair.

1406
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:22,308
I did.

1407
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:25,501
I've looked everywhere and the
brooch is nowhere to be found.

1408
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:30,082
[sighing] Give it back.

1409
01:22:30,107 --> 01:22:31,206
Right now.

1410
01:22:31,569 --> 01:22:33,408
But I didn't take it, Miss Cuthbert.

1411
01:22:33,433 --> 01:22:35,067
Honest, I didn't.

1412
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:36,582
I don't believe you.

1413
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:38,514
Where else would it be?

1414
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,993
Confess at once.

1415
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:42,861
But I...

1416
01:22:42,886 --> 01:22:45,975
I'm not going to live
with a thief under my roof.

1417
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:48,690
You confess to stealing the brooch,

1418
01:22:48,725 --> 01:22:50,725
or you have no future
here at Green Gables.

1419
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,568
- But I didn't take it.
- Confess.

1420
01:22:52,929 --> 01:22:55,330
Or I'll send you right
back to the asylum.

1421
01:22:57,190 --> 01:22:58,904
If I don't confess...

1422
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,402
you'll send me back?

1423
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:03,709
Confess to what you have done.

1424
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:08,177
If I do, can I stay
here at Green Gables?

1425
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,879
Did you, or did you
not, take the brooch?

1426
01:23:16,599 --> 01:23:18,652
I lost it. I... I was...

1427
01:23:18,687 --> 01:23:22,442
I was playing Lady Cordelia when
I took the brooch outside with me.

1428
01:23:22,903 --> 01:23:24,158
As I was drawing water from the well,

1429
01:23:24,193 --> 01:23:27,161
I leaned over to make
a wish and it fell in.

1430
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:31,499
I heard it make a splash as it
disappeared down into the depths.

1431
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,235
I'm ever so sorry, Miss Cuthbert.

1432
01:23:39,143 --> 01:23:40,774
Pack your things.

1433
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:43,744
But you said if I
confessed I could stay!

1434
01:23:43,779 --> 01:23:46,750
I told you that brooch
meant a great deal to me.

1435
01:23:46,775 --> 01:23:49,650
No, b-b-but I made it up!
None of that was real!

1436
01:23:49,685 --> 01:23:52,896
I didn't take your brooch!
I don't know where it is!

1437
01:23:52,921 --> 01:23:55,388
Please, Miss Cuthbert,
you have to believe me!

1438
01:23:55,413 --> 01:23:57,090
I don't have to do anything.

1439
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,219
Please, Miss Cuthbert...

1440
01:23:58,244 --> 01:24:00,384
I can't trust one
word out of your mouth.

1441
01:24:00,621 --> 01:24:02,254
- Please...
- Enough.

1442
01:24:03,356 --> 01:24:05,395
You're not to leave this room tonight.

1443
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,632
Tomorrow, you will go... at first light.

1444

1445
01:26:25,724 --> 01:26:27,064
Matthew!

1446
01:26:27,872 --> 01:26:29,528
Matthew!

1447
01:26:29,553 --> 01:26:30,652
Yah! Yah!

1448
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:33,386
Yah! Giddy-up!

1449
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:36,512

1455
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:11,120
Did I miss it? Did I miss the train?

1456
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:14,163
Not to worry, your
girl got on all right.

1457
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:17,718
